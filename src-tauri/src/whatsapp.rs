//! Native WhatsApp accounts, backed by the `whatsapp-rust` multi-device client.
//!
//! This replaces the embedded WhatsApp Web child webviews: instead of rendering
//! `web.whatsapp.com` in a browser, the app speaks the protocol directly. Each account has
//! two SQLite files under the app's local data directory: `<id>.db`, the protocol session
//! owned by `whatsapp-rust`, and `<id>.chats.db`, the chat history (see `whatsapp_db`).
//!
//! History arrives from the phone right after pairing; older messages of a chat can be
//! asked for on demand. Media is downloaded on request and decrypted here; read receipts
//! and presence are not wired up yet.
